Starter project w/ Webpack,  Babylon.js, TypeScript. This is a minimal project -- nothing will be created
except for a full window-sized canvas with a sphere.

Using this project is simple, just run

npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

This was tested using `node 12.6.0`. You can install it using `nvm`:
